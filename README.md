## Pings
Using a carrot-on-a-stick (placeholder), you can place an in world marker for other players, to direct their attention. 
The colour of the ping matches your username set with the colour picker.
Can target blocks and entities using a ray-casting system, entity pings appear above the head of that entity and block pings appear on the surface it hit.
This also intelligently switches to an underwater mode when underwater. It should also account for thin blocks, although not for slabs and stairs currently.

## Settings
This datapack provides a clean and comprehensive settings menu, with folding options to hide sub-options when disabled. This also includes a clean uninstall feature, which will ensure this datapack does not leave behind a massive trail of old scoreboards.
